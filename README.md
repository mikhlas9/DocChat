Chatbot App
Overview
Chatbot App ("DocChat") is a web application that allows users to upload documents (PDF, JPG, PNG) and chat with an AI to extract information from the uploaded documents. The app is built using Next.js for the frontend, Firebase for authentication and database storage, and integrates with the Google Generative AI API for natural language processing. The app features a responsive UI with a sidebar for chat history, a document upload interface, and a chat window for interacting with the AI.

Features

Document Upload: Users can upload PDF, JPG, or PNG files to interact with.
Chat Interface: Users can ask questions about the uploaded document, and the AI responds using the Google Generative AI API.
Chat History: A sidebar displays past chats, allowing users to switch between conversations.
Responsive Design: The UI is optimized for both mobile and desktop devices, with a toggleable sidebar on mobile.
Authentication: Firebase Authentication is used for user login and registration.
